# Changelog — ORACLE Suite

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-02

**The continuity release: the handoff stops depending on memory and discipline.**

- **Live cross-session handoff line.** `sessionend` gains Phase 5 ("Open the live line"): in
  multi-session environments (Claude Code desktop) the ending session stays alive, records a
  "Live line:" row in `START-HERE.md`, proactively sends the successor a six-part orientation
  message, and answers its setup questions from full context. `oracle` gains the receiving end:
  when resuming a continuation it finds the predecessor (Live-line row or `list_sessions`), reads
  the docs first, then messages one consolidated batch of questions — falling back to transcript
  search if the predecessor is closed. Templates: `skills/sessionend/references/live-handoff-template.md`.
  Proven in production on a real project handoff before shipping.
- **Automated continuity hooks** (new `hooks/`): `SessionStart` detects a `START-HERE.md` /
  `HANDOFF.md` in the working directory and injects a resume nudge as context; `PreCompact` (auto)
  reminds that a deliberate `/sessionend` handoff preserves more than compaction.
- **Memory layer.** `oracle` intake queries available persistent memory (Claude Code auto-memory or
  a memory MCP) before the Content question; `sessionend` Phase 3.5 deposits a handoff digest into
  writable memory. Files stay the source of truth; memory is the finding aid.
- **`critic --panel`**: multi-lens panel mode (correctness · security · economics · adversary ·
  feasibility) with cross-lens adjudication — findings that survive multiple lenses outrank any
  single lens's severity call.
